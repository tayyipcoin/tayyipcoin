## Why mine RTE?
Because, as a world leader; Recep Tayyip Erdogan is our last hope to save his country; Turkey, and all Muslims and finally the whole world! Nowadays, he struggles with many coup plans, massive protests and an neomessianic-masonnic islamic sect: Gulen Movement. Finally a graft probe hit his ministers and his son. Erdogan labeled this probe an assassination attempt. If you mine Tayyipcoin, you will help his non-capitalist New Galaxy Order plans. When all RTE's mined, RTE will be the single official currency all over the galactic empire.
